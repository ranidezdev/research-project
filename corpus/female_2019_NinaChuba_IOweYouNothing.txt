Fast lane with a clear vision
The top of the chain is my real mission
Boy got me in this game just to play it with him
And now he's in my fucking way, changing my rhythm
We lit this fire up together to get to another level
Now it slowly starts to flicker and flicker, 'cause he's the devil
Hate to see me moving in high speed (High speed)
He's losing solo, he's no longer in my league
Sleeping with the enemy, my ex named Drama
You want everything served on a silver platter
Sign on the dotted line or you turn prima donna
Right now you are listening to karma
I owe this man nothing
I owe this man nothing
I owe this man nothing, nothing
I owe this man nothing
I was polite when we were talking on the phone
But I'm gonna take it all the way, all the way
Have my people credit you on the song
'Cause you made me take it all the way, all the way
I owe you nothing (Think about that)
I owe you nothing (Think about, think about that)
I owe you nothing (Think about, think about that)
So I'm gonna take it all the way, all the way
Why you gotta be bitter when we could've been better together?
Whatever I'ma forget you were ever
Involved in this journey to glitter, gold dust and heavy hitters
The hits you made are just a light tap on this rhythm
The tracks we made back then, just sic' em
They ain't me now kid, nah nah, I'm sick of them
Call me menacing when you know that I'm innocent
You mean only business, so this is the business end
Sleeping with the enemy, my ex named Drama
You want everything served on a silver platter
Sign on the dotted line or you turn prima donna
Right now you are listening to karma (Karma, karma, karma)
I owe this man nothing
I owe this man nothing
I owe this man nothing, nothing
I owe this man nothing
I was polite when we were talking on the phone
But I'm gonna take it all the way, all the way
Have my people credit you on the song
'Cause you made me take it all the way, all the way
I owe you nothing (Think about that)
I owe you nothing (Think about, think about that)
I owe you nothing (Think about, think about that)
So I'm gonna take it all the way, all the way
