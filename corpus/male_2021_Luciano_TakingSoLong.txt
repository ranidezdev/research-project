Hey brother, my sister (wo wo wo way well wo well ell )
What's going on
Why we can't  live  as one
Tell me what’s going on?
I wanna talk to you
Tell me why has it taken so long?
For us to live as one
Tell me brothers and sisters what's wrong?
Where's the loving gone?
What's going on?
I see the world is changing, and caving in on us
Still we continue to be so unjust
Fighting amongst ourselves
Pushing and grabbing, for material wealth
Though we're children of one mother and father
And descendants of our ancestors
Tell me why can't we come together as one?
Tell me why has it taken so long?
For us to live as one?
Tell me brothers and sisters what's wrong?
Where's the loving gone?
What's going on?
What about Martin Luther’s dream, that one day we would be free?
(What about) what about the great philosophies of Honorable Marcus Garvey
(And what about) and what about those songs of Bob Marley?
And what those teachings of His Majesty?
Still we're blind, and cannot see
Tell me why has it taken so long?
We just can’t live as one
Tell me brothers and sisters what's wrong?
What's going on?
What’s going on?
Come let's live to love again (we can do good and we can be better)
And rid our hearths of this sorrow and pain
Let righteousness rule and reign (we can do good and be better)
In our lives again
Why has it taken so long?
For us to live as one?
Brothers and sisters tell me what's wrong?
What’s going on?
Where's the loving gone?
Why has it taken so long
For us to live as one
Brothers and sisters tell me what's wrong?
Where's the loving gone?
What's going on?
How many more lives must go down the drain?
