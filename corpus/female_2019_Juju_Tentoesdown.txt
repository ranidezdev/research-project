Yea
(Verse 1)
Fuck a girlfriend
I really ain’t putting in work
You tell me that you love me
But baby all you did was lurk
Baby trust this
It all came from the heart
Just let me put in work
Just like the fucking start
Man Tell me that you love me
Man Tell that you miss me
I never got those words from nobody
All I got was dissing
Was I really missing
All we did was talk
All I wanted was kissing
Argument by argument
All you did was fusing
Man you never stopped cussing
Let me just say a few words
Coming straight from the heart
That really was my baby
Man that shit was so crazy
I pulled up on the daily
Man It’s all about you lately
I tell you that I love you
When you really think I’m hating
It’s only been about you
Baby you know what I’m saying
I promise you baby
Man I fucking with nobody
Love and affection
Was all in my body
(Verse 2)
I pulled up with 2 girls
Yea yea and I praise
I tell you that I love you
Man I tell you that I miss you
Never took the time to listen to my issues
You never wanna hear you never wanna see
All the shit that I went through
I go day by day
Crying my eyes thinking you’ll stay
I pray every night and every single day
It’s hard for me to say I still love you till this day
Just baby listen up
Please don’t walk away
When you hearing this song
Just think about our wrongs
Now hear me say that
I was never strong
Yea yea
