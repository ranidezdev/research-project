It’s so far away
This tiny thing called entropy
The end of all you’ve ever been
But you can’t sleep
And I can’t lie to you
Like all the grown up people do
The clock stops, people go
People go
If I could lock up light in your little heart
Keep your innocence of the deep down dark
I would (I would, I would, I would, I would)
In the dead of night, I’ll be here by your side
Ghosts don’t sing so you know that I’m alive
I still get the dreams and the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you; the pills, they lie to you
You can’t stop the time when it's time that you go
There's no god but it’s better you know
I still get the dreams and the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you, I don't wanna frighten you
Oh, if I could save
You from the fear of yesterday
From what will go and what will stay
It wouldn’t change a thing
It's been haunting me (My dear)
I’m just as small as yesteryear
Drink until it disappears
It won't disappear
If I could lock up light in your little heart
Keep your innocence of the deep down dark
I would (I would, I would, I would, I would)
In the dead of night, I’ll be here by your side
Ghosts don’t sing so you know that I’m alive
I still get the dreams and the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you; the pills, they lie to you
You can’t stop the time when it's time that you go
There's no god but it’s better you know
I still get the dreams and the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you, I don't wanna frighten you
