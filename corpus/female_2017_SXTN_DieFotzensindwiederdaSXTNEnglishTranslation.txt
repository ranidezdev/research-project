One, two
SXTN stops by
Three, four
Knocks at your door
Five, six
You're in trouble again
Seven, eight
The cunts are back again!
The cunts are back again!
I smell the other rapper's cold sweat, all the dogs wimp out again
'Cause the SXTN EP was pretty great and this thing will get big like Shanghai
Realtalk from a mannish hag, who actually can rap a little apparently
We shoot you like Ramstein and y'all still rap like in France
You can gladly do my dishes, image can't make y'all cool
'Cause y'all shake my hand like it's a washcloth
Breath in, breath out and knock off the ash
Knock off the ash onto your mom, SXTN's got the hypе
Fuck everyone, causе in 2017 I want huge diamonds
You don't think anyone can break you, but trust me it only takes a smile, man
You're a pet, i'm a predator and I'm looking for prey
With you I go to a champagne reception dressed like a lesbian
I get all your bitches and steal your last gram in the end
Two dipshit bitches are better than the usual Kylie Jenner
Somehow I get on better with men, you know?
'Cause I like to suck for ten bucks, bitches
No, we are unique, we are exclusive
Get your tickets for the best team!
We fuck your mama
We're in the studio everyday
There comes the drama again
And you're still a son of a bitch
Today we're fucking the scene, no one else matters
We are great trash, y'all are just trash
Now you want to copy us, but we are the original
The cunts are back again!
The cunts are back again!
Y'all are just ugly boys, we are back on track
And the next sixteen bars fuck German rap up the ass
Many copy and imitate us, our groupies are so hot
This record is in the charts, S-X-T-N original
We are back again, new hits for the hood
Y'all waited long enough, this beat will break you
Award-winning rapper or fucking spoiled fatso
We are here and we're better
We come to your city, rock it live, the crowd is thrilled
There is no competition in this fucking country
You sell your ass for promo
Black is a trend color again since I'm back
A hater in the begining but now you're a stalker
You have a shitty personality and no lowcarb can help you
Your fans are shit, mine paint me a wholecar
I was already famous when i was broke
We fuck your mama
We're in the studio everyday
There comes the drama again
And you're still a son of a bitch
Today we're fucking the scene, no one else matters
We are great trash, y'all are just trash
Now you want to copy us, but we are the original
The cunts are back again!
The cunts are back again!
One, two
SXTN stops by
Three, four
Knocks at your door
Five, six
You're in trouble again
Seven, eight
The cunts are back again!
The cunts are back again!
The cunts are back again!
