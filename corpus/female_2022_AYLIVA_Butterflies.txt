The way you look for her is breakin' my heart, yeah
Do you not remember the night we spent in the dark?
We talked about depression and anxieties, relationships in families
And now I just have to accept that she is what is meant to be
Oh, mentally
I could never forget all the things you said you want to be
I could never forget how you treated my priorites
Yeah, I left everything for you
Forgot about myself whilе you was lovin' someone new
Shе's pretty
Yeah, I know, she's pretty
With all her flaws
Be with her, go be with her, I know
Yeah, you look happier
With somebody who's healthier
Inside her head butterflies
Inside my head you and I
Yeah, you look happier
With somebody who's healthier
Inside her head butterflies
Inside my head you and I, you and I
Wish I could have run to you
Wish this world wasn't so cruel
Told me not to fall for you
Didn't you fall for me too?
I-I-I can't hold back my tears
Hold back, ohh
Why you look happier
With somebody who's healthier?
Inside her head butterflies
Inside my head you and I
Yeah, you look happier
With somebody who's healthier
Inside her head butterflies
Inside my head you and I
You and I, you and I
I, I, I
Mmm
