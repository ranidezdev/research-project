Ha-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Born in '98, it was my mother and I
Only my brother was there, my father was not, ey, yeah
Six years ago came a present
I had to learn responsibility
Nudžejma, I cherish you with honor
Grey clouds, but I can see the sun
Shining through the fog, a glow
And the eyes shine even in dark times
Does the glimmer of hope help liberate me?
Angels are screaming, demons are crying
No, I don't trust any of them
Cold inside, spirit is stone
With me at pеace, the vest is whitе
When I go, I see white
Pay the price at the end of my life
I'm surrounded by sharks
So I go around in circles
But when I go, I see white
And when I go, I see white (I see white)
I wake up, look in the mirror
Behind me are clouds of smoke and thieves
I don't need anything from them
I'll stay strong, rely on love
Better not, better I stay alone in my room
The same wallpaper, the television flickers
Yet, I keep my face
Greed is a sin, just content with how it is
But thankful every day for what God gives me
Hah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Hah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
When I go, I see white
Pay the price at the end of my life
I'm surrounded by sharks
So I go around in circles
But when I go, I see white
And when I go, I see white (I see white)
