I got enemies, got a lot, okay not a lot
But they all into me, unintentionally
Venom men with small fuck boy energy who don't speak to me
The type to just type and they hide behind a screen
All sweaty while their mom cook sketti
'Cause they were never ready
Left the nest, and hit the ground like the rest of us
Normal, everyday, citizens
Who keep our pretty mouths zipped shut if we're not interviewed
Did I ask a question? Little boy, I think not
If I want opinions, you're the last of the lot
Don't worry, I will ask if I ever give a fuck
Actually I have a question, you're broken
Please tell me, who hurt you?
Come to mama, baby, get a hug
Who hurt you?
Tell me who it was and it could stop
Who hurt you?
Parents never tell you they were proud?
Who hurt you?
Tell me what it is, tell me what it is about
Come to mama, baby, get a hug
Who hurt you?
Tell me who it was and it could stop
Who hurt you?
Parents never tell you they were proud?
Who hurt you?
Tell me what it is, tell me what it is about
I read all your comments, I do
I'm a sad bitch, who needs validation too
I'm ignorant, I thought the internet was cool
Filled with like-minded people who would love what I do
And I know you take it literal so take this too
My fucks never grew 'cause I had money to recoup
20/20 2020 will be stacked with the truth
A click is a penny and a penny turns to two
Soon I'll have a dollar, and I'll owe it all to hate
Rebbeca black it to put food on my plate
I guess I gotta thank you, you showed me it's true
I'm an industry whore, now tell me who hurt you?
Come to mama, baby, get a hug
Who hurt you?
Tell me who it was and it could stop
Who hurt you?
Parents never tell you they were proud?
Who hurt you?
Tell me what it is, tell me what it is about
Come to mama, baby, get a hug
Who hurt you?
Tell me who it was and it could stop
Who hurt you?
Parents never tell you they were proud?
Who hurt you?
Tell me what it is, tell me what it is about
