Baby, I'm so hype, hype to be where I are
Is this what life taste, like caviar?
That shit is some salty, salty, salty beluga
But fuck, it feels so nice to be, fuck
Baby, I'm so hype, hype to be where I are
Is this what life taste, like caviar?
That shit is some salty, salty, salty beluga
But fuck, it feels so nice to be bourgeoisie, ah-ooh-ah
It's risky business, mm
For the biscuit, witness, sickness
Tell bitches, "Keep distance"
Social, vicious
Do my make-up in the glass ceilin'
So pretty, nice feelin'
Seen not hear, shit unstirred
I do coke but I love the earth
I don't choke on my surf and turf
My conscience never had trouble
I'm not that type who would meddle with the muggles
JK, LOL, don't pop my bubble
Or I'ma be real mad, real sad
I'll cry, make you feel bad
So sly, make you step back, make you wish that
You would have learnt how to bitch fight
Baby, I'm so hype, hype to be where I are
Is this what life taste, like caviar?
That shit is some salty, salty, salty beluga
But fuck, it feels so nice to be bourgeoisie, ah-ooh-ah
Mm, I wanna TMI for the TMZ
Trade D to C celebrity
Trade all of me for vanity
Subscribe to scientology, red carpet all my house
Endangered species on my neck, you know what I'm about
Credit score in the red, see this Prada?
I keep bouncin' all my checks, that's just drama
On the list for all events, nirvana
Where the buffet? Where the fucking caviar-ar?
Baby, I'm so hype, hype to be where I are
Is this what life taste, like caviar?
That shit is some salty, salty, salty beluga
But fuck, it feels so nice to be bourgeoisie, ah-ooh-ah
Baby, I'm so hype, hype to be where I are
Is this what life taste, like caviar?
That shit is some salty, salty, salty beluga
But fuck, it feels so nice to be bourgeoisie, ah-ooh-ah
