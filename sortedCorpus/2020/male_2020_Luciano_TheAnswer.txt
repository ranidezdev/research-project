Nature, space, time, people, mind
We gotta learn to live
And share the blessings of life
But we must learn to love
Jah is the answer for all the world today
He is the answer and love is the way
Jah is the answer if we could just obey
He is the answer and love is the way
Today easy, but the future's not secure
About tomorrow, we are not so sure
Only the Father's gracе can save us this time (One timе)
The way we living with so much violence and crime (Why do we fight?)
Why do we fight each other (Why do we fight?)
When we know we need to work together?
God has made us that we can co-exist
Let's open up our eyes and I'm sure we will see
Jah is the answer for all the world today
He is the answer and love is the way
Jah is the answer if we could just obey
He is the master showing us the way
When in this time and space, in this dispensation
It's up to the human race, responsibility is everyone's
To make a contribution and find within a solution
Amidst this global confusion
For so long, we've been apart from each other
Now we've got to come together
Jah is the answer for all the world today
He is the answer and love is the way
Jah is the answer if we could just obey
He is the master showing us the way
Showing us
Jah is the answer (Jah is, Jah is)
Jah is the answer (Jah is the answer, love is the way)
Jah is the answer, love is the way
