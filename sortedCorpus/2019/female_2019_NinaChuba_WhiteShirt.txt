Isn’t it funny
You talk so much behind my back
But then you hug me
Turning around, twisting the facts
But call me buddy
Backhanded compliments
Black-sanded coasts
But waters too cold
Waves wild as your arguments
Thought about it once
I don’t see the problem
Think about it twice
If this is worth the trouble
Think it’s what you want
And what you want, I got it
Better take your time
You better make up your mind
Now I got all this bad blood
On my white shirt
But I keep it so I know
All the nice things
Yes, you turn them into something that they’re not
I know things are not like they used to be
Why can’t you just be happy for me
Fighting this war
What is it for?
What is the point?
Always holding back the blessing
And I really hate it
Nobody’s gonna steal your crown even if I make it
Don't know why I'm caught up in the drama, tryna fake it
We slowly fading, fading
Thought about it once
I don’t see the problem
Think about it twice
If this is worth the trouble
Think it’s what you want
And what you want, I got it
Better take your time
You better make up your mind
(Fuck it)
Now I got all this bad blood
On my white shirt
But I keep it so I know
All the nice things
Yes, you turn them into something that they’re not
I know things are not like they used to be
Why can’t you just be happy for me
Fighting this war
What is it for?
What is the point?
Now I got all this bad blood
On my white shirt
But I keep it so I know
All the nice things
Yes, you turn them into something that they’re not
I know things are not like they used to be
Why can’t you just be happy for me
Sick of this war
What is it for?
What is the point?
I don´t need your applause, no
What I want is a companion
So let you hear me out before I get rid of your toxins
I know things are not like they used to be
Why can’t you just be happy for me?
Fighting this war
What is it for?
What is the point?
I know things are not like they used to be
Why can’t you just be who you wanna be?
Sick of this war
What is it for?
What is the point?
