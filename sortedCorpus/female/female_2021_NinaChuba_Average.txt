Should I cut my serotonin with a lie to make it last?
Should I power pose in panda face and cry, "I'm never sad"?
If I joke about the end, could I trick myself to laugh? Ha
Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average
Maybe if I gave my life to money, I'd be happy
Dumb and dumber, martyrdumb it down for greener grasses
Maybe if I never tried unpacking my baggage
Say I'm savage when really, I'm just average
I find that everyday that it gets harder to admit
That when the mask misfits and my stomach feels sick
Maybe I'm a piece of shit? (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Maybe I should just quit? (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
But I reach between the dopamine to find a thread of meaning
Find a finer line to walk that might actually redeem
A little shred of positivity (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
A little tiny bit of energy (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

I'm talkin' to you
Please tell me the truth
Please tell me what I should do?
Maybe my brain, it'll listen to you
I'm huntin' silver lines
But I only see them when out of my mind
Die for genuine smile
Lower than low, it could take me a while

(Cut my serotonin, cut my, cut my serotonin)
(Power pose in panda, power, power pose in panda face)
(I joke about the end, joke, joke about the end)
(Say I'm savage when really I'm just average)
(Cut my serotonin, cut my, cut my serotonin)
(Power pose in panda, power, power pose in panda face)
(I joke about the end, joke, joke about the end)
I can't do that, I'm too insecure
(Say I'm savage when really I'm just average)
