Sorry if I'm coming up savage
Open bar got me feeling like I can
There’s so many pretty people pirouetting
In a coked up superficial dance
And I really wanna say it to your face
But I don't know which one to talk to
Scared of everybody in the place
Cause they got a million ways they could bite you
Sorry if I'm coming up savage
I wanna live, I made it a habit
Dog eat dog does damage
And I wanna live
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there, I´ve seen it
They do cut-throat things down in the jungle
They eat all the humble
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there, I’ve seen it, I joined in
In the dance of oblivion
K-k-kill for a million
The godless waisting of air
And the worst is nobody cares
Fake friends, fake foes, brutalize
Fake smiles, Shit show, don't wanna die
This is competition, everyone's ambitious
Numero uno til everyone falls
Till everyone falls
Til everyone falls
Sorry if I'm coming up savage
I wanna live, I made it a habit
Dog eat dog does damage
And I wanna live
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there I´ve seen it
They do cut-throat things down in the jungle
They eat all the humble
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there I've seen it, I joined in
In the dance of oblivion
K-k-kill for a million
The godless waisting of air
And the worst is nobody cares
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there I´ve seen it
They do cut-throat things down in the jungle
They eat all the humble
They cut their teeth in the jungle
Ive been there I've seen it, I joined in
In the dance of oblivion
K-k-kill for a million
The godless waisting of air
And the worst is nobody cares
