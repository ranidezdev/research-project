There is no faking, no heartbreaking
Like a volcano, this true love is shaking
In tender caring we are partaking
Woman me feel, see big things in the making, yeah
Intoxication of a certain kind, yeah
I will admit that you suit my mind, yeah
Palpitation of another kind
Don't fast forward, Baby, just rewind, yeah

And I will always be a part of you
Jah Jah made us and He will see us through
Always and forever, babygirl, this love is true
I've been searching for the longest time
Almost givin' up, never thought I would find
Seen many roses die on the vine
But a hidden treasure in you I may find
Joy inna your eyes, me nuh see no tears
Love is what you giving me throughout the years
Every time you need me
I will be there my dear, I swear
Joy inna your eyes, me nuh see no tears
Love is what you giving me throughout the years
Every time you need me

On the magic carpet we will ride
Venus, Jupiter to the other side
Fi we togetherness, nuh need no guide
There is nothing fi go shame, nothing fi go hide, no, no
A whole new world await
Brighter than the pearly gates where
Love is as strong as fate
And life is about to give and to take
Ah-ah-ah-ah
To give and to take
Ah-ah-ah-ah
To give and to take
Joy inna your eyes, me nuh see no tears
Love is what you giving me throughout the years
Every time you need me
I will be there my dear, I swear
Joy inna your eyes, me nuh see no tears
Love is what you giving me throughout the years
Every time you need me
I will be there my dear, I swear
