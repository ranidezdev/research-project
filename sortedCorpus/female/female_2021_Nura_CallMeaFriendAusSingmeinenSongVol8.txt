We spent our days in the winter
Dreaming 'bout the sunshine
And we dropped pills when we’re younger
To go on journeys in our mind
We pack it up, we drove it out
On the the open road we'd change our lives
And all it took was a cold dark pass
And boy, I saw you looking
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
End
Oh baby, I don't know
We drove out east to thе country line
Hit the border somеtime ’bout sunrise
We stuck our feet in the cold wet grass
And girl, I saw you looking
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
End
End, end
Oh baby, I don't know
I was never looking for a lover like you
But still you came in my way
This love is gonna thrill, but God it's gonna kill
It's gonna give me pain
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
Could you do me that? Call me a friend
Another lover like you would only be my end
End
End, end
Oh baby, I don't know
